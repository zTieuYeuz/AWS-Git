**AWS Site-to-Site VPN** is a service that helps securely connect on-premises networks with the AWS cloud over the internet. AWS Site-to-Site VPN allows the creation of an encrypted VPN connection between the on-premises network and AWS, supporting high-security standards, ensuring strict security, and maintaining a stable connection with your network system.

By using AWS Site-to-Site VPN, you will gain the following benefits:

- Ensure high security with data encryption throughout the transmission process.
- Easily integrate with other AWS services such as EC2, VPC, S3, CloudWatch, etc.
- Centralized management and simplified connection with multiple branches.
- Support routing protocols like Static Route and BGP to optimize routing.
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN helps save time and costs, while simplifying the deployment and maintenance of secure connections between on-premises and AWS.

With these advantages, you can also use VPN instead of Direct Connect, which helps save costs when it comes to transmission lines.
**VPN Cost** of Site-to-Site VPN is calculated based on a fixed cost of approximately 36 USD per month for one VPN Connection. This cost does not include the traffic cost going out of the VPC.
